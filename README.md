GiftDraw for Android
====================

The initial version of my Secret Santa name-picking app, which has since become [a web app](https://www.github.com/LouieGeetoo/giftdraw-web).

This limited, buggy version of GiftDraw lets you add people, put them into groups (members of the same group will not be assigned each other's names), and then randomly assign two recipients to each giver.

GiftDraw for Android requires that [ActionBarSherlock](http://actionbarsherlock.com/) be included as a library project in order to compile. At the time I was last working on it, GiftDraw was using ABS 3.4.0, though more recent versions may work.
